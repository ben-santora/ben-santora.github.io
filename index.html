                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>I am currently focused on evaluating small language models in efficient, CPU-only environments. My work sits at a pragmatic intersection of AI and systems engineering, where performance, determinism, and clarity matter more than novelty.

I view language models as tools for reasoning, abstraction, and instruction rather than as replacements for the operating system. The shell remains the most capable and reliable agent for real work. AI is most effective when it translates human intent, explains concepts, or assists with design decisions, while execution is left to the Linux toolchain. By allowing Bash and standard utilities to manage files, processes, and streams, workflows remain explicit, fast, and resource-efficient.

My current focus includes testing small language models such as gemma-3-4b under constrained, CPU-only conditions to assess their real-world viability outside GPU-centric assumptions. I emphasize systems engineering practices that rely on established Unix tools like grep, awk, and pipelines for deterministic behavior and predictable performance. A central goal of my work is optimizing workflows that bridge AI reasoning with system-level execution, ensuring that each component is used where it is strongest rather than where it is fashionable.
